The dataset consists of 6100 images with 50399 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*face*).

Images in the Dark Face dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 100 (2% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (6000 images) and *test* (100 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the Peking University.
